| Project        | Description         |   Stack  |
| ----------- |------------| -------|
| [Chat](https://ya-maz.github.io/chat-test/) | A test task where it was necessary to do a chat according to a specific layout from figma, connect to data and receive message history. Also reshape the work of the chat on socket.io What's new I've used here: styling tabs, infinite scrolling, sending and receiving messages using socket.io Code [here](https://github.com/Ya-maz/chat-test).  | React, styled-component, socket.io|
| [Todos](https://ya-maz.github.io/todos-angular/) | Second tutorial project for introducing angular. Here you can see the work of the application "TODOS" with local data, as well as the second application "TODOS with ngrx"  that works with libraries such as rxjs and ngrx. Applied a library based on "Flux" architecture (used actions, reducer, selector and effects). Code [here](https://github.com/Ya-maz/todos-angular).  | Angular2, Rxjs, NGRX, Typescript|
| [Movies](https://ya-maz.github.io/Movies)      | Training project for gaining experience of Typescript, Redux and Redux-Saga. This application is working with api https://www.omdbapi.com/. The difficults that I have overcome: routing, styles with boostrap-react, typing, sorting items, deploy. Code [here](https://github.com/Ya-maz/Movies).  | React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Typescript, Eslint, Prettier|
| [BeerTime (FC)](https://ya-maz.github.io/BeerTimePage)      | Pet project for gaining experience of React with function components (Refactoring BeerTime(Class Component)). See page "Catalog". The tools I used here: Hooks, Registration, Verification, item filter. Code [here](https://github.com/Ya-maz/BeerTimeWithFunction). | React, Hooks, Registration Form |
| [BeerTime(ClassComponent)](https://ya-maz.github.io/BeerTimePage)      | Pet project: catalog page with async requests, react lifecycle method, filter, feedback form with validation, dialog(modal). UX/UI - at my discretion. Code [here](https://github.com/Ya-maz/BeerTime). | React, React.Component, Lifecycle method |
